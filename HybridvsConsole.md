| **Performance Optimization**   | ‚ö†Ô∏è The same resource usage as **Desktop Mode** due to active Windows services (though optimized with HandleOS tweaks). | ‚úÖ Fewer running services, leading to **potentially better performance** in some cases. |
| **Customization**              | ‚úÖ Can modify and replace the UI while keeping Windows fully functional. | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited customization, mainly optimized for running lightweight applications. |
